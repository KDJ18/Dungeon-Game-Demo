# Dungeon-Game-Demo
First demo for me and Dylan's dungeon game.
# Description
Dungeon crawler style game with grid-based movement.
# Story
You wake up in what appears to be some sort of prison. 
All you hear is the sounds of violence and mystery. 
Your objective? Figure out how you ended up here. 
Various hurdles await, as this 'prison' ends up revealing more secrets and corruption than what was once hypothesized.
